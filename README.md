#### Abstract: The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

#### Data Set Information:

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

I will be using this Bank Marketing Data Set for my Final Project in Purwadhika.
At the moment, this repository is still incomplete as i have not yet finish with it.
So until then, please wait for further updates!
